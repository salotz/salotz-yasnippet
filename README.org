* My Yasnippet collection

Yasnippet (annoyingly) enforces a directory structure which
corresponds to the mode snippets are for. I want to organize them by
topic, e.g. I have some for coding and some for organizational
stuff. Unfortunately, the modes these are used often overlap.

So I organize them by topic, and then by the mode. The idea is that
any individual topic is portable and could in theory be its own
repository. I just needed a "nursery" repo to start until any one
topic became big enough to warrant having a standalone separately
maintained repo.

This does mean that you can't just make a single symlink to this repo
and be done.

I have a script that merges the modes from different /sources/ (the
unit of a topic) into a single place at ~$XDG_DATA_HOME/yasnippet~
which then I have a single configuration line in my ~.emacs~ that
loads this.
